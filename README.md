- **Summary:** With every passing day technology is becoming increasingly entwined with the lives of people from all walks of life whether they realize it or not. This burgeoning relationship between people and technology has already changed almost every facet of society in one way or another leaving few areas, if any, untouched. It is my view that the future of humanity largely rests on our ability and will to shape these incredibly powerful tools as a force to improve the human condition and reduce suffering around the world. We are only beginning to wake up to the critical necessity for a realiable means of securing the technological bedrock upon which the infrastructure of our societies increasingly rest. It is my mission to gain an in-depth understanding of technology and cybersecurity such that I can wield it to defend the defenseless, uphold the security of all that is good in society and upset exisiting power structures when necessary.
